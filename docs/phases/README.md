# The Pet Game Delivery Phases

This folder contains two documents per phase:

1. `phase-XX-plan.md` (what/why/scope/acceptance)
2. `phase-XX-build-plan.md` (how/tasks/tests/done)

## Phase Order

1. Phase 01: Foundation and PWA Scaffold
2. Phase 02: IndexedDB Data Layer and Seed Data
3. Phase 03: App Shell, Navigation, and Profiles
4. Phase 04: Pets Tab and Photo Capture Flow
5. Phase 05: Store, Inventory, Wallet, Transactions
6. Phase 06: Breeding Flow and Event History
7. Phase 07: Export/Import, QA, Release Readiness

## Execution Notes

1. Build each phase in order.
2. Do not skip phase acceptance checks.
3. Keep all code TypeScript + React + Vite and offline-first.
4. Keep local-first constraints: no backend, no auth, no paid services.
